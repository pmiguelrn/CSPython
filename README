In this file I pretend to explain all my improvements in the python course

So what I learn until now:

 - Now I have my master file at CSPython.
 - To add a file i have to type:
      	  git add <name of file>
 - To commit a file type:
          git commit <name of file> -m "message about the improvements made"
 - To push the commited file go GitHub:
          git push <name of file>

I have a few problems initially with the creation of the repository, because i did the:

       - git remote add origin htpps://...

in the repository behind

I resolve this problem with:

   - git pull inside the CSPython repository

Other commands 

- git remote -v
